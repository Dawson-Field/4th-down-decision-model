# 4th Down Decision Assistant

This project uses a machine learning model trained on historical NFL play-by-play data to help teams decide whether to **go for it**, **punt**, or **kick a field goal** on 4th down.

Built as a football strategy tool, it brings advanced analytics into one of the most critical in-game decisions â€” with real-time recommendations based on game context.

## Project Goal

To support **data-driven decision-making** in football by modeling optimal 4th down choices based on historical outcomes and in-game variables.

## Model Overview

The model was trained using:
- `nfl_data_py` play-by-play data (multiple NFL seasons)
- `PyCaret` for model training and evaluation

### Features Considered:
- Field position (yards from opponent's end zone)
- Yards to go for a first down
- Score differential
- Quarter
- Time remaining in the quarter
- Timeouts remaining (offense & defense)

### Outcome:
The model classifies each scenario into one of three decisions:
- Go for it
- Punt
- Field Goal Attempt

## Development & Testing

- Built-in Python with full preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training in `fourthdownmodel.ipynb`
- Tested on unseen 2024 play-by-play data to validate predictive performance
- Future enhancements may include:
  - Win probability integration
  - EPA (Expected Points Added) impact analysis
